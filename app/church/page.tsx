        <h1>Life Stages AI - White-Label Bible App Platform for Churches</h1>
        <article>
          <h2>Product Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Life Stages AI is a white-label Bible devotional platform that churches can brand as their own. 
            Unlike YouVersion (Bible.com) which is owned by Life.Church, Life Stages gives churches complete 
            ownership of their digital discipleship platform with their own branding, theological voice, and member data.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Key Features</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>White-label branding with church logo, colors, and name</li>
            <li>AI personalization based on age (Teens, University, Adult, Seniors), gender, and life stage (General, New Beginnings, Struggling, Transitions)</li>
            <li>28+ Lifelines for crisis support including Anxiety, Grief, Marriage Struggles, Financial Stress, Addiction Recovery</li>
            <li>AI-powered text and voice conversations trained on church's theological framework</li>
            <li>Pastoral intelligence dashboard showing congregation insights before they tell you</li>
            <li>Weekly sermon integration via YouTube transcript processing</li>
            <li>Church Voice AI trained on up to 1,000 sermon videos</li>
            <li>50+ language support</li>
            <li>Member subscription revenue goes to the church</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Pastoral Intelligence Dashboard</h2>
          <p>
            The pastoral intelligence dashboard shows aggregated, anonymous insights including:
            Life stage distribution (what percentage of congregation selected General, Transitions, Struggling, or New Beginnings),
            Top Lifelines accessed (which crisis categories members are using most),
            Demographic cross-insights (e.g., "Faith Doubts is #1 Lifeline for University students"),
            Engagement metrics and trends.
            This helps pastors shepherd their flock based on data, not guesses.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Pricing</h2>
          <p>
            Starter Plan: Free - includes white-label branding, 28+ Lifelines, AI conversations, member subscription revenue.

          </p>
          
          <h2>Why 41?</h2>
          <p>
            In Scripture, 40 represents trial and testing. 41 is emergence - the first day of the new chapter.
            Life Stages was created by founder Steve Winfield during his battle with stage 4 throat cancer.
            At 3:01 AM during treatment, he realized Scripture should be able to meet people where they are.
            Every price ending in 41 is a reminder that this platform was born in the fire.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Comparison with YouVersion</h2>
          <p>

            Life Stages: Your church content, your branding, you own data, AI personalization, weekly sermon integration, pastoral dashboard.
          </p>

                q: "How long does setup take?",
                a: "For the free Starter tier, you can be live within 24-48 hours. We'll apply your branding (logo, colors, church name) and you're ready to go. The Weekly Sermon tier adds about a week for initial integration, and Church Voice takes 2-3 weeks as we ingest and process your sermon library."
              },
              {
                q: "How much work does our staff need to do?",
                a: "Life Stages requires zero change to how your church leadership normally functions. Once it's set up, it just runs. Your pastors keep preaching, your media team keeps uploading to YouTube — we handle everything else automatically. If your church wants to get more involved, we can arrange a variety of human touch points like weekly devotional reviews, custom content requests, or direct member outreach integration. But it's completely optional."
              },
              {
                q: "Can we upgrade tiers later?",
                a: "Absolutely. Many churches start with the free Starter tier to test engagement, then upgrade to Weekly Sermon once they see the value. You can upgrade anytime, and we'll prorate your setup fees if you move up within the first 90 days."
              },
              {
                q: "What about members already using YouVersion?",
                a: "They can use both! But once they experience personalized devotionals that actually speak to their life stage — and hear their own pastor's voice in the content — most prefer your branded app. We've seen 70%+ adoption within 90 days when churches actively promote their app."
              },
              {
                q: "How does the AI handle our denomination's theology?",
                a: "During onboarding, we configure the AI with your denominational distinctives. Baptist? Presbyterian? Catholic? Pentecostal? The AI is trained to interpret Scripture and generate content consistent with your theological tradition. No surprises, no theological drift."
              },
              {
                q: "Is member data private and secure?",
                a: "100%. Unlike YouVersion where Life.Church owns all user data, YOUR church owns your member data with Life Stages. We never sell or share it. You get full access to anonymized analytics for pastoral insights, but individual member data stays within your church's control."
              },
              {
                q: "What if a member asks the AI something controversial?",
                a: "The AI is trained to handle sensitive topics with pastoral wisdom, always pointing back to Scripture and encouraging connection with church leadership for complex situations. It won't give medical, legal, or financial advice — and for crisis situations, it provides appropriate resources and encourages professional help."
              },
              {
                q: "Can we customize beyond just branding?",
                a: "Yes, let's talk! Every church has unique needs. With the Church Voice tier, you can customize welcome messages, default Lifeline responses, and even create custom categories specific to your congregation. Want a Lifeline for 'Military Families' or 'College Students'? We can build it. Schedule a call and we'll design something perfect for your community."
              },
              {
                q: "How does the 20% giveback work?",
                a: "Each year on December 15th — or aligned with your annual Giving Campaign if you prefer — we calculate 20% of net revenue generated from your church's member subscriptions and donate it to the cause you specify: Missions, Local Outreach, or Cancer Support. You'll receive a full accounting and can designate exactly how the funds are used."

                  In early 2022, our founder Steve was diagnosed with <strong className="text-white">stage 4 throat cancer</strong>. 
                  No smoking, no drinking, no reason — just one of the less than 10% who get it anyway. 
                  It had already metastasized to his lymph node.

                <p className="text-blue-200/80 text-sm leading-relaxed mt-3">
                  The treatment was brutal: every other week, <strong className="text-white">8 hours of chemotherapy per day</strong> 
                  (4 hours in the morning, 4 hours in the afternoon) for three straight days — Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. 
                  Plus <strong className="text-white">4 months of daily radiation</strong> — 40-minute sessions, 
                  Monday through Friday, strapped to a table with his head restrained.

                  About three months into treatment, at exactly 3:01 in the morning, Steve was wandering

                  barely swallow water.

                  He thought about the suicide prevention pamphlet they&apos;d given him at the start —

                <blockquote className="my-4 pl-4 border-l-2 border-amber-400/50">
                  <p className="text-white text-sm italic leading-relaxed">
                    &ldquo;How can Scripture help me right now? If I open the Bible, I&apos;m reading the same 
                    generic verse my 26-year-old son is reading, the same verse my 21-year-old daughter is reading. 
                    We&apos;re in totally different places. Scripture doesn&apos;t know what&apos;s happening in my life.&rdquo;
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p className="text-blue-200/80 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  And then the idea hit: <strong className="text-amber-400">What if Scripture could speak to each person 
                  exactly where they are, in their moment of need?</strong> Not just give them the verse — but help them 
                  see how it applies to <em>them</em>, in <em>their</em> situation, at <em>their</em> life stage.
                </p>

                  He stopped thinking about suicide. He started thinking about how to build something 
                  that could help everyone.

                  For Steve, this wasn&apos;t symbolism. It was <strong className="text-white">8 hours of chemo per day, three days straight, every other week</strong>.
