CRITICAL RULES:
- Only cite stories that are REAL and VERIFIABLE
- Include historical figures, documented testimonies, well-known conversion stories
- Each story must be from a real person with a real name
- Provide the source or how they can verify it (book, organization, historical record)
- If you're not certain a story is real, don't include it
- Focus on stories that relate to the spiritual theme provided

Types of real stories to consider:
- Historical conversions (Augustine, C.S. Lewis, etc.)
- Missionary accounts (Jim Elliot, Corrie ten Boom, etc.)
- Modern documented testimonies from ministries
- Published memoirs and autobiographies
- Verified accounts from organizations like Voice of the Martyrs, Samaritan's Purse, etc.`,
