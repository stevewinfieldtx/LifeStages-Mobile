                <p className="text-blue-200/80 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  In early 2022, our founder Steve was diagnosed with <strong className="text-white">stage 4 throat cancer</strong>. 
                  No smoking, no drinking, no reason — just one of the less than 10% who get it anyway. 
                  It had already metastasized to his lymph node.
                </p>
                <p className="text-blue-200/80 text-sm leading-relaxed mt-3">
                  The treatment was brutal: every other week, <strong className="text-white">8 hours of chemotherapy per day</strong> 
                  (4 hours in the morning, 4 hours in the afternoon) for three straight days — Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. 
                  Plus <strong className="text-white">4 months of daily radiation</strong> — 40-minute sessions, 
                  Monday through Friday, strapped to a table with his head restrained.

                  About three months into treatment, at exactly 3:01 in the morning, Steve was wandering 
                  the house like a zombie. Couldn&apos;t sleep. Couldn&apos;t eat. A feeding tube because he could 
                  barely swallow water.

                <p className="text-blue-200/80 text-sm leading-relaxed mt-3">
                  He thought about the suicide prevention pamphlet they&apos;d given him at the start —

                  In that darkest moment, Steve thought about Scripture. And what struck him was this:

                    &ldquo;How can Scripture help me right now? If I open the Bible, I&apos;m reading the same 
                    generic verse my 26-year-old son is reading, the same verse my 21-year-old daughter is reading. 
                    We&apos;re in totally different places. Scripture doesn&apos;t know what&apos;s happening in my life.&rdquo;

                </blockquote>
                <p className="text-blue-200/80 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  And then the idea hit: <strong className="text-amber-400">What if Scripture could speak to each person 
                  exactly where they are, in their moment of need?</strong> Not just give them the verse — but help them
